# Asylum
## Why did I make this?
This bot was made for a Discord server that has now either died, or shrunk and got rid of the bot.
## What does it do?
It's a really simple discord bot that stoppped working. It has very basic moderation commands.
## Contact Information
Add me on Discord `Max Thakur#0831`, or make a issue and I'll get around to fixing it as this is a pretty much dead project, but I will still help!
